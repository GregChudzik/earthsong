# earthsong
An infinitely-generated musical composition whose content is dictated by the position of the earth around the sun, the moon around the earth, and the earth's rotation.  The frequency of the seven tones are at unison during sunrise and sunset, and gradually drift to form the 1st seven tones of the overtone series at solar noon before drifting back to unison at sunset, and repeating the process using the undertone series that is fully realized at lunar noon.  The duration of the long tones as well as the density of the short tones are inversely proportional to eachother depending on the time of day.
